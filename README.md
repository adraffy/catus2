#Catus 2: Warlords of Draenor
##World of Warcraft Simulator
Catus is a max-level Warlords of Draenor-compatible World of Warcraft simulator for the purpose of theorycrafting PvE raid content.  Initially, Catus will be Feral-only.

Catus is being developed in Java for cross-platform support.

Catus 2 is the successor to [Catus 1: Mists of Pandaria](http://fluiddruid.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4574).

###Project Goals
1. Positional Combat (2d positioning, ranged based attacks, travel time)
2. Multiple Independently-scripted Units
3. Multiple Class Support
4. Accurate Emulation

###Companion Projects
1. **CascLib** -- CASC file-format reader to extract latested game data.
2. **WarJson** -- server-side DBC to JSON data exporter.  Transforms the messy internal game data into useful, self-contained JSON objects.  This is the successor to [Raffy's Blizzard JSON Item API](http://raffy.antistupid.com/wow/items.php).
3. **WarKit** -- a client-side wrapper around WarJson's Item API which supports armory importing, paperdoll, items, enchants, gems, etc.

###Progess
Under construction!  There's literally nothing useful in this project yet.
